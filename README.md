# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
As I wasn't familiar with the newer Excel vesions, there was a huge learning curve.

## Results 1

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
1. Many of the successful plays were launched in April to June.
2. Many of the plays launched in winter didn't meet its pledged amount.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
1. Most of the plays with pledge amount less than 10000 is successful.
2. The plays with pledged amount greater than 50000 is mostly failure.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
Different plays are pledged at different countries and each country has different currency. It is not clear from the data that the goal and pledged amount in the data from each country and currency. The currency column is misleading as each currency value is different. This whole Data Analysis is done considering the fact that the currency is US Dollars for all the amounts.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
- Graph based on outcomes based on plays different countries.
